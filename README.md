# cmd-calculator

A command-line calculator, my first project made in C++. Containing a couple of mathematical operators and functions. This calculator was written without using stack, as a challenge to create a functioning calculator without converting the standard infix syntax to postfix notation `(Reverse Polish Notation)` and as I said before - the stack. The return type of most of the operations is `long double`, where using the stack we could use `void*` as in [btmills calculator](https://github.com/btmills/calculator). That's why this calculator is a complete tragedy, but hey! It works, right?

# Operators

* `+` Addition
* `-` Subtraction
* `*` Multiplication
* `/` Division
* `^` Exponent
* `%` Modulus

# Functions

* `abs(n)`- Absolute value
* `floor(n)`- Floor
* `ceil(n)` - Ceiling
* `sin(n)` - Sine
* `cos(n)` - Cosine
* `tan(n)` - Tangent
* `asin(n)` - Arcsine
* `acos(n)` - Arccosine
* `atan(n)` - Arctangent
* `sqrt(n)` - Square root
* `cbrt(n)` - Cube root
* `log(n)` - Logarithm
* `exp(n) ` - Exponentiation
