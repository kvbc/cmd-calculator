# cmd-calculator

A command-line calculator, my first project written in C++. Containing a couple of mathematical operators and functions. This calculator was written without using the stack and for calculations it uses the standard infix notation. The return type of most of the operations is `long double`, where using the stack we could use `void*` as in [btmills calculator](https://github.com/btmills/calculator). That's why this calculator is a complete tragedy, but hey! It works, right?

# Operators

* `+` Addition
* `-` Subtraction
* `*` Multiplication
* `/` Division
* `^` Exponent
* `%` Modulus

# Functions

* `abs()` - Absolute value
* `floor()` - Floor
* `ceil()` - Ceiling
* `sin()` - Sine
* `cos()` - Cosine
* `tan()` - Tangent
* `asin()` - Arcsine
* `acos()` - Arccosine
* `atan()` - Arctangent
* `sqrt()` - Square root
* `cbrt()` - Cube root
* `log()` - Logarithm
* `exp() ` - Exponentiation
