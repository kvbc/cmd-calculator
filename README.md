# cmd-calculator

A command-line calculator, my first project written in C++. Containing a couple of mathematical operators and functions. This calculator was written without using the stack and for calculations it uses the standard infix notation.

# Operators

* `+` Addition
* `-` Subtraction
* `*` Multiplication
* `/` Division
* `^` Exponent
* `%` Modulus

# Functions

* `abs()` - Absolute value
* `floor()` - Floor
* `ceil()` - Ceiling
* `sin()` - Sine
* `cos()` - Cosine
* `tan()` - Tangent
* `asin()` - Arcsine
* `acos()` - Arccosine
* `atan()` - Arctangent
* `sqrt()` - Square root
* `cbrt()` - Cube root
* `log()` - Logarithm
* `exp() ` - Exponentiation
