# cmd-calculator

A command-line calculator, my first project made in C++. Containing a couple of mathematical operators and functions. This calculator was written without using the stack, as a challenge to create a functioning calculator with standard infix notation and as I said before - the stack. The return type of most of the operations is `long double`, where using the stack we could use `void*` as in [btmills calculator](https://github.com/btmills/calculator). That's why this calculator is a complete tragedy, but hey! It works, right?

# Operators

* `+` Addition
* `-` Subtraction
* `*` Multiplication
* `/` Division
* `^` Exponent
* `%` Modulus

# Functions

* `abs()` - Absolute value
* `floor()` - Floor
* `ceil()` - Ceiling
* `sin()` - Sine
* `cos()` - Cosine
* `tan()` - Tangent
* `asin()` - Arcsine
* `acos()` - Arccosine
* `atan()` - Arctangent
* `sqrt()` - Square root
* `cbrt()` - Cube root
* `log()` - Logarithm
* `exp() ` - Exponentiation
